>>py -m venv venv  

#activate virtual environment   
>> venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Now you can run the pip install command
>>pip install -r plugin.txt

#to run your project, you need to start your application
>>py manage.py runserver

#to create database migration, sqlite is been used so you won't need db credentials settings 
>>py manage.py makemigrations

To manage your database with the default sqlite database, visit /admin in your admin panel
#create a default user account to access admin panel
>>py manage.py createsuperuser
